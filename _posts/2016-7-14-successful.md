## Tips
- Watch the news. Looking at the events that happen everyday all around the world will inspire you to write more ' real and non-fiction ' stories.

- Spend time with your family. There are many things that happen when you're around your family such as celebrating birthdays and different holidays. If you're going to have such events in your stories, it will be better to take part in them yourself.

- Be a risk-taker. This is important specially if you write about ' exciting ' things in your story. By being a risk-taker, I don't mean killing a person or committing a crime. Take fun risks such as riding a roller coaster and share your experience from them in your story.

- Take a trip to a close city or country if possible. Change of atmosphere can help a lot in your story ideas.

- Carry a notebook wherever you go! This could be for writing whenever you have spare time, or if you need to write down ideas.

- Outline stories! Some people think it's boring and useless, but most famous authors do it. Write out a short summary, draw diagrams, do whatever helps you become more familiar with the plot and storyline.

- Write about the main characters. This could involve drawing them to create their appearance, writing a brief description, and anything else related to your character(s).
